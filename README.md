# Books-Recommendation-System

## Overview
This project uses **natural language processing** and **machine learning** techniques to analyze movie plot descriptions and predict genres. Before the classification task, data preprocessing and exploratory analysis were performed, including text cleaning, lemmatization and visualizations. A recommendation system was also created based on 1-grams and 2-grams to suggest similar movies.

## Highlights
- Tesxt preprocessing: punctuation removal, lowercasing, stopword removal, lemmatization
- Exploratory analysis with visualizations to understand genre distributions and description patterns
- TF-IDF feature extraction using unigrams and bigrams
- Recommendation system leveragin n-gram similariy for movie suggestions
- Classification using Multinomial Naive Bayes, Random Forest and Linear SVC
- Cross-validation and test set evaluation with precision, recall, F1 and accuracy
- Key insights on genre-specific language patterns and feature importance
